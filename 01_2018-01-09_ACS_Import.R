# filter data to match the socioeconomic descriptors

# Name:           Percent Aged Under 18 or Over 64	
# Description:    Percent of the population under 18 or over 64 years of age 
#                 (i.e., dependency)

# Name:           Percent Aged 25+ Without High School Diploma
# Description:    Percent of persons aged 25 years or older without a high school diploma

# Name:           Percent Households Below Poverty
# Description:    Percent of households living below the federal poverty level

# Name:           Per Capita Income
# Description:    A community areaâ€™s per capita income was estimated by dividing 
#                 the aggregate income of the census tracts within the community area 
#                 (from table B19313) by the [aggregate] number of residents.


# Name:           Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed
# Description:    Percent of persons aged16 years or older in the labor force that are unemployed


# Name:           Percent of Housing Crowded
# Description:    Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room 
#                 (i.e., crowded housing)


# Name:           Hardship Index
# Description:    The hardship index is a score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators according to the method described in An Update on Urban Hardship 
#                 (see footnote 2 on page 53 of http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/cities_and_neighborhoods/2004-08-an_update_on_urban_hardship.pdf). 
#                 Scores on the index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship. 
#                 The scores are standardized according to the data for the 77 community areas, 
#                 and therefore cannot be compared to scores generated for other jurisdictions.
