## R Folder

This folder contains all R files that contain the research and calculations of the Hardship Index as well as the data imports for Community Area mapping. This folder contains the ACS imports of the variables that are relevant for the Hardship Index (ACS_Import), the trials to find the equation for the Hardship Index (Hardship_Chicago) and its documentation in a readme file (Formula_README), the import of the GEOJson for Chicago Community Areas (importinc_cca), and the calculations for the Hardship Index with the Great Cities Institute data (Great_Cities_Hardship), which was the model we used for the app.
