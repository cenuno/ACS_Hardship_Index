# Purpose:  Calculate a hardship index for each community area in Chicago
#           using ACS 2012-2016 5-Year Estimate using 6 SES variables to update
#           'Census Data - Selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago, 2008 - 2012'
#            a public data set made available on the Chicago Data Portal.
#            Available here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2/data
# Note:     For more on the index metholodgy, see the following:
#           https://github.com/cenuno/ACS_Hardship_Index/blob/master/articles/2004-08-an_update_on_urban_hardship.pdf
#         
#           The formula standardizes each of the 
#           component variables so that they are all given equal weight 
#           in the composite Intercity Hardship Index. 
#           The Index represents the average of the standardized 
#           ratios of all six component variables. 
#           The Intercity Hardship Index ranges from 0 to 100 with 
#           a higher number indicating greater hardship.
